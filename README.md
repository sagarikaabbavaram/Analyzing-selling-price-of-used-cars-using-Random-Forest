# Analyzing-selling-price-of-used-cars-using-Random-Forest
Predicts car prices using Random Forest, including data preprocessing, feature encoding, model training, evaluation (MAE, R-squared), and feature importance visualization.
This project predicts car prices based on various features using the Random Forest algorithm. The dataset includes various car attributes, and the model is trained to provide accurate price predictions.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and prepares the dataset for training.
- **Model Training**: Utilizes Random Forest Regressor for price prediction.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared metrics.
- **Feature Importance Visualization**: Visualizes the importance of different features in predicting car prices.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-price-prediction.git
   cd car-price-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Place your dataset (CSV file) in the project directory and update the file path in the code.

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to see the predictions and results.
